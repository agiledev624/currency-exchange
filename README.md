## Project Requirements
The test task is to showcase Currency Exchange Functionality using CRA (Create React App). 

Scenario - user has three wallets:

USD (initial balance $200)
EUR (initial balance €150)
GBP (initial balance £10)
  
Criteria:

Switch wallets e.g: EUR > GBP., GBP > USD., USD > EUR.
Enter the desired amount to exchange and has a CTA (call-to-action) to conclude the transaction.
Use this (https://exchangeratesapi.io/documentation/) or similar API to get the conversion rates.
Wallet balances are updated correctly.
Show an error message when the desired exchange amount exceeds the current balance.
 
Bonus points:

Nice friendly UI
Code quality
Unit Tests
